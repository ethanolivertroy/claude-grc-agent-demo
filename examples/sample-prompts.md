# Sample Prompts

## FedRAMP Assessment
- Review this SSP against the FedRAMP Moderate baseline AC family controls and return enhancement-level findings.
- Assess AC-2 through AC-2(5) and identify which enhancements are missing for FedRAMP Moderate.
- Evaluate the SSP's control origination designations — which controls should be inherited vs shared vs service provider system?
- Generate POA&M entries for all partially satisfied controls with risk-based remediation timelines.

## CMMC
- What CMMC level can we achieve based on our current SSP?
- Assess our CUI handling procedures against CMMC Level 2 requirements.
- Map our NIST 800-53 controls to CMMC practices.
- What gaps do we need to close to go from CMMC Level 1 to Level 2?

## Baseline Selection & FIPS 199
- Our system processes CUI with Moderate confidentiality, Moderate integrity, and Low availability. What FedRAMP baseline and DoD Impact Level do we need?
- Apply the FIPS 199 high-water mark to determine our categorization and recommend the appropriate baseline.

## AI Governance
- Assess this AI system card and model card against the NIST AI RMF. What's our maturity across GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE?
- What risk tier does our document classification system fall under in the EU AI Act?
- Review our model card against ISO 42001 requirements.
- This AI system processes CUI for DoD — assess it against both CMMC Level 2 and NIST AI RMF simultaneously.

## Federal + AI Intersection
- Assess this DoD AI system against both CMMC Level 2 and AI governance requirements. What are the unique compliance challenges for an AI system handling CUI?
- Our AI system is deployed on AWS GovCloud IL5. What additional controls beyond FedRAMP High do we need for IL5 authorization?

## Cross-Framework
- Map these NIST 800-53 controls to ISO 27001 and CMMC equivalents.
- We need to comply with both FedRAMP and CMMC — show me the overlapping controls.
- How do NIST AI RMF requirements map to ISO 42001?

## OSCAL
- Parse this OSCAL SSP and assess the implemented-requirements against FedRAMP Moderate.
